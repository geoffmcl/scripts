# Script Repo

Just a collection of scripts, probably mostly perl that I can not live without, in any machine...

So what better way to store them but in this small repo...

##### Note on perl script versions

Here appended digits are used to denote a later version.

That is, for example, `findap03.pl` is the latest version in the `findap` series... even if the older versions are not present...

And, as another example, `do-square02.pl` is a continuation of `do-square.pl`... and so on...

This is done when the current version reaches what might be called a fully `functional` state, and about to sometimes drastically modify what is really working ok... 

In certain circumstance this can be almost a full re-write, but usually just adding some more comlexity, or simplicity! to the script. Hopefully an improvement ;=))

The previous versions usually then remain `unchanged`, unless on occasions a `bug` really needs to be backwards applied.

##### More perl scripts

On my web site there is a page dedicated to `perl` - http://geoffair.org/mperl - Down the page there is a link to `Samples` which is irregularly updated with all the current and old scripts... over a thousand scripts at last count...

Have FUN ;=))
